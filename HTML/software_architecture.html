                The game of battleship is built in Python using a total of five classes. These classes are <i>Game</i>, <i>Ship</i>, <i>Board</i>, <i>Player</i> and <i>BDIAgent</i>.
                <br /><br />
                The Game class is the most abstract class and uses methods and logic found in</span> other classes in order to describe in what manner a session of Battleship is played. In this class such things as switching between players and switching between the two game stages of Battleship is facilitated.
                <br /><br />
                Battleship evolves around figuring out the locations of the opponents ships by choosing locations to hit. Ships, therefore, are an important element of the game. Battleship uses a total of five ship types. These are the carrier, battleship, cruiser, submarine and destroyer. Within the game these ships differ in only two ways. These are the label or name and the dimensions of the vessel. Due to this ships have been coded by using an inheritance structure. The <i>Ship</i> class holds all information and behavior which is found in all ship types. Each particular ship type is represented by means of a ship specificclass which inherits from the <i>Ship</i> class.
                <br /><br />
                Each player has a board at its disposal. In the original version of Battleship, the board holds information on both the location of one players own ships as well as locations of the opponents board which were hit. These locations are marked in such a way as to show whether the location harbored a ship or not. In the Python implementation of Battleship, the <i>Board</i> class holds similar information. It uses a <i>hitgrid</i> to keep track of locations which are hit by the opponent as well as a <i>placesIShot</i> grid. The <i>placesIShot</i> grid is used to keep track of hit locations on the opponents board, while the <i>hitgrid</i> represents hit locations on the players own board. The <i>Board</i> class, aside from holding information on the game state, also facilitates placing ships on the board as well as processing shots. Finally, the <i>Board</i> class offers an evaluation function. The function evaluates the players game position by calculating a score. The score is based on how many ship parts are still unharmed and how many hits the players ships have received. This score is used in calculating the preference of particular move intentions.
                <br /><br />
                Finally there are the <i>Player</i> and <i>BDIAgent</i> classes. These represent agents which are able to participate in a session of Battleship.The former class has methods which enables a player to place ships on the board, check whether the player is still ‘alive’, what needs to be done in order to receive a hit and how to shoot. These are the basic actions necessary for any player to play Battleship. <i>BDIAgent</i> is a sub-class of <i>Player</i> and therefore inherits all these necessary actions. In addition the agent class has methods which enable the class to autonomously engage in the game.
                <br /><br />
                The <i>BDIAgent</i> utilizes knowledge of the game in order to evaluate the most preferable move to arrive at the goal state. Knowledge such as killed ships, hit locations, the state of the players own ships, known opponent ships, ships the opponent knows of and potential opponent ship locations are all taken into account in order to choose an intended move. As such this information is constantly updated throughout the games session.
                <br /><br />
                In order for the <i>BDIAgent</i> to reason about its next intended move it uses the knowledge it possesses. This is done by reasoning not only about the best move the agent itself can intend, but rather also by reasoning about the opponents best counter move. However, due to the nature that not all knowledge in the game is common knowledge, the extent at which the agent can reason about the opponents best move is limited. For instance, it is unknown to the agent where all of its opponents ships are located. This information limits the opponents actual possible moves. Therefore an agent may expect and reason about its opponent executing a certain move, while in actuality a different move is intended by the actual opponent.
                <br /><br />
                The logic involved in the decision making process of the <i>BDIAgent</i> may be found in section <a href="logic.html">BDI Agent</a>. This section introduces the Believe Decision Intention (BDI) logics involved. However, it needs to be stated that the <i>BDIAgent</i> chooses its intended move by evaluating the possible board states after a number of moves. To limit the amount of possible worlds, only a set of reasonable possible worlds are considered. The <i>BDIAgent</i> limits the moves it expects to those that would change the board state closer to the goal state, while expecting the opponent to reason along the same logic.
